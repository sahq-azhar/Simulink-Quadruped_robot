<h1 align='center'> Quadruped Robot Using MATLAB-Simulink  </h1> <br>



This repository contains the Simulink model and various supporting libraries for a Quadruped robot. This model was made for a competition and a initial simulation before planning for a prototype and building the finished robot was made to understand the various gait patterns that can be obtained using specific chassis and leg configurations. The final robot can be seen on the YouTube link provided below.

This model was created referring to 
- [MATLAB and Simulink Robotics Arena: Walking Robot](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64227-matlab-and-simulink-robotics-arena-walking-robot?s_tid=srchtitle_walking%20robot_6)
- [mathworks-robotics/msra-walking-robot](https://github.com/mathworks-robotics/msra-walking-robot) 

kudos to the team for putting together such a great project.
It's all because of them that I was able to comprehend and learn from that model and create this.

Issues Resolved
--------------------------------------------------
Had a particular issue with joints going out of place was resolved later on after using revolute joint as suggested by a Matlab staff (Sebastian Castro).Thanks to him for helping.
