----------------------------------------------

This model was created referring to 
- [MATLAB and Simulink Robotics Arena: Walking Robot](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64227-matlab-and-simulink-robotics-arena-walking-robot?s_tid=srchtitle_walking%20robot_6)
- [mathworks-robotics/msra-walking-robot](https://github.com/mathworks-robotics/msra-walking-robot) 

kudos to the team for putting together such a great project.
It's all because of them that I was able to comprehend and learn from that model and create this.

--------------------------------------------------
Had a particular issue with joints going out of place was resolved later on after using revolute joint as suggested by a matlab staff (Sebastian Castro).Thanks to him for helping.
